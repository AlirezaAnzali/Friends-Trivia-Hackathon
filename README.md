# Friends Trivia Hackathon
This is a fun react application project created by my friend Marco and me during a 24-hour hackathon. While I worked on the front-end, Marco handled the server side. I submitted the project with hard-coded data on the client-side.

## Features
The project has the following features:

- Asks five questions about the Friends TV series.
- Provides the correct answer after each question, and if the user chooses the correct answer, it increases their score.
- Shows the user's final score at the end of the quiz.

## Installation
To install the application, clone [this repo](https://github.com/AlirezaAnzali/Friends-Trivia-Hackathon) to your local machine.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: Navigate to the cloned client side repository folder and install the necessary dependencies using npm install command in your terminal:

    $ npm install

This will install all the required packages specified in the package.json file.

2. Run the client side by following command:

    $ npm start
    
After running the npm start command in the client side folder, the React development server will start up and you should be able to view the application in your browser.
